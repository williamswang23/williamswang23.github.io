The shock has less effect on most countries in the first half but will become the real food shortage in the second half in some poor countries, such as Africa and Southeast Asia countries.<br>The fame will lead to more conflicts between developed counties and developing counties. It will also push up the global inflation, all classes will be undermined by this shock. The living standard level of living will decline unavoidable, especially for those commons with high Engel’s coefficient.<br>The food price inflation will transfer to other living materials, such as the service industry, the energy industry, and other labor-intensive industries. The sector’s rising price will rotate in a long term. Those conditions will give the central bank heavy pressure on rising interest rate to fight the complete inflation.<br>The food price inflation will come with the energy price inflation because of the enormous energy demand in the north sphere. All panic will continue to the summer of 2023, the new agriculture season’s coming.<br>The export countries will be benefited from those inflations. But import countries will face higher products price. However, there is an excepted country, the USA, if it rises the Fed interest rate, the eroding effect of importing inflation will be hedged by the exchange rate effect. At the same time, the export countries, for instance, China, South Korea, and other manufacturing countries, will expand their export volume. Even those countries will face the same intense inflation shock, but the employment rate can keep at a better level than in 2022. The pande    mic shock is unprecedented in ever.</p>
