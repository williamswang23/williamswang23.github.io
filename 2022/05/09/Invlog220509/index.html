The inflation rate of the US is too high to undertake by the Americans if the Fed couldn’t keep a strong shrinking monetary policy from now on. By contrast, the Chinese always keep low inflation resulting from deleveraging policy. Therefore, not only shrinking is the nominal spread between US and China, but also the real spread.<br>The real interest rate spread is the driver of investment decisions of the institutional investors, and the nominal spread is the driver of redemption of their funding or liabilities. The market data reveals both of those spreads declined in this period. The escape of foreign investment reflects the change in the exchange rate of usdcny or usdcnh.<br>The lockdown policy also shocks the Chinese supply chain and demands. The CPI and PPI will soar in short term but plunge in the long term cause of the supply chain shifting from China to other labor-intensive countries. The fall of manufacturing will erode residents’ income, then bring a demanding shock.<br>The currency depreciation can hedge the effect of those shocks to some extent. It will make the productions made in China becoming more attractive to foreign customers. However, this implementation also pushes the inflation of raw materials for Chinese producers. Breaking this dilemma should depend on the improvement of the total productivity. The effective measures include policy reformation and technology revolution.</p>
