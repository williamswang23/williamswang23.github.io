From this topic, I began to think about whether that comparison is accurate or not. The conclusion is the one who has a similar opinion confuses the definition of memory.</p>
<p>Firstly, for humans, memory means a change in their brains. Scientific research reveals that the interaction and link of the neural cell will change when a human tries to remember something. The link can be looked at as weights in a NN. Indeed, the LSTM can remember patterns by the weights and the gates. From this perspective, the NN’s memory capacity cannot compare with the humans’ at this stage. </p>
<p>Secondly, the memory that ordinary people understand is not the one referred to above. The computer can remember everything only if its memory disk storage is enough. However, this memory is stored. The information storage and recording in human society were written on paper or stone in antiquity and multimedia in contemporary. The information recorded in those ways can also be kept long-term. The only difference between computers and human is the speed of searching. Computers’ information searching speed is faster than humans’ in most fields. That is why humans will utilize the computer to assist in completing missions. </p>
