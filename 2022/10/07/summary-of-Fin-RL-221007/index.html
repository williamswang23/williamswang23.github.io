The relevant papers are finite and lacking citations.  </p>
<p>The reasons behind this phenomenon are various. It will discuss in following aspects. </p>
<p>First of all, Rl is a new field for the AI industry. That means the researchers interested in the RL field are a minority in the AI industry. Moreover, the papers using the RL method to study financial problems are more sparse than other traditional financial or economic methods. </p>
<p>Secondly, the AI researchers focusing on RL are focusing more attention on solving more determinate problems, such as full or partial information problems. The representation of the former is the Game mission, such as the Go game. The latter are some computer games such as StarCraft I. The advantages of those missions are the following: </p>
<ol>
<li>The data generation is more straightforward;</li>
<li>The training process can ignore the limitations of time or location</li>
<li>The features of data are extracted more easily.<br>Those advantages of current research have not existed in many financial sub-fields. They are collected in the following points.</li>
<li>The financial data generation process is too difficult to mimic the real process. However, it can be collected the actual financial data easily. Those data may result in a biased training set because those sample data are almost biased. On the other hand, using some classical models to generate simulated data also has some flaws. For example, when the analysts produce the training data by the classical CIR model, a stochastic process model, some assumptions are inconsistent with the actual financial market. </li>
<li>Many risk factors will affect the financial market and asset price. Those factors affect asset price through two transformations. One is risk averse effect. The other is the time delay. That led to the experiment’s environment becoming more complex than the Game. </li>
<li>Feature engineering should be optimal in the future. It is a crucial step in the financial analyzing process.</li>
</ol>
<p>At last, from a fundamental mathematical perspective, there is too little research on mining the relationship between Rl and finance, especially at the current studying level. The papers in Fin-RL are just focusing on method-borrowing. There is a huge gap needing to fill in the future. </p>
