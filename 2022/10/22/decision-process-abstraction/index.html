<p>The ZEN has a magical theory that you will return back to the initial point when you have experienced some special feeling, the dunwu. For the decision process problem, this pattern are also suitable. </p>
<p>There is a classical situation that when investors face many assets, he will under confusion in his decision process. Actually, many problmes are homogenerous in abstracted perspective. That means information compression is a great way to find a optimal solution. Although, it will loss some details in this process. The improvement of understanding would cover that loss. Indeed, the compression is a two shape sword. Anyone working on DP field should tradeoff the pros and cons based on their unique experience and intuition. </p>
<p>The general capacity is a crucially important skill in AI, at least in the DP or RL research. Some studying methods using in manifold are a typical example of information compresion. The only point should be noticed is people need understand which part of information are compressed and the loss is significant or not. In other word, the researchers should comprehend rationality of compression and make this tool undercontrol. </p>
<p>Someone has a prejudice sight for those RL researchers who are focusing on teaching the AI investment skills. They think the humans should be responsible for analyzing while the computers are responsible for taking the orders. However, in my view, the opinions of formers is rational but too myopic. They do not have enough imagination about the enormous power of AI. They are just some conservations. </p>
<p>The investment process can be separate into two parts. One is intuition which belongs to the humans. The other part is repeated word, such as accumulating expecrience and marking some simple deductions, which belong the computer and AI. The humans’ brains should put their attention to explore the fundamental rules of the problmes. Moreover, The humans have the duties to build a framework of basic atoms but not the concrete methods.  The methodology is alway more critical than methods. </p>
