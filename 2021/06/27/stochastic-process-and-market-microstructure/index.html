<p>the CIR and its homogeneous models are classical descriptions for modern financial theory. all of those models are composed of two modules, the drift term and volatility term. the volatility term almost has a similar assumption: the price process matches normal or quasi-normal stochastic process. additionally, we have also known financial data which some investors could collect from open market data sources are sample data to analyze or back-test trained model. theoretically, sample data are cooperate with population or not, while volatility term has random walk property. both of that are likely to mean none can predict or capture market price pattern in short term. i only agree with the opinion partly.</p>
<p>in my view, the dz of volatility term is just an indicator. the fluctuation of asset price depend on not only external factors, but disturbances in time dimension. however, those factors are indirect factors. the most direct factors are trading behaviours of traders. or, the more suitable metaphor is multiple agents system. all economic and financial indicators as variables are transferred to different agents active system $A_i$, which are a black box for other traders, moreover, its outputs also are hidden by market information partly, the trickers. all traders look at the external factors and market information to try to find some trails. the information leak of someone depends on his orders management strategy. </p>
<p>there are two tasks for building an algorithm trading agent. action module and evaluation module. </p>
<p>evaluation module:<br>sub-module 1: information collection module. collecting related indicators and information to analyze middle and long term market trend. output of this sub-module is low information-noise ratio for evaluating market.<br>sub-module 2: differential module. comparing disclosure market data with a variety of time periods and frequency. the benchmark data included historical data and artificial data which source from DNN or trained RL agents.<br>sub-module 3: MCTS. the details of evaluating method depend on market power clustering level. more detail about MCTS in an un-public essay: mcts.</p>
<p>action module:<br>Q-learning, TD-learning, etc..</p>
<p>all of the above illustrate a method to demonstrate market is pseud-random walk. any trader will mark his signature behind others’ noise. there may some way to extract information from chaos of market if we have enough patience and energy. fortunately, high computing power can assistant us to achieve those targets. none can capture all information of counterparts, but the good hunter can shot big bears. the market has some inherent patterns behind its chaos. </p>
<p>to be continue…</p>
