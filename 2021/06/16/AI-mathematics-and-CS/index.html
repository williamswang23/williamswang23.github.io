<p>as someone knows, the AI filed has a huge progress in recently. actually, the AI is a general concept, and there are multiple branches  under it.  but all of branches of it have a common basis, mathematics,and it is also a basis of general CS. </p>
<p>first of all, i agree with Mr LeCUn totaly, the physical is a field to describe from the universe to nano particles. the mathematics is a field to extract abstract principle from some concrete stuffs. both of two subjects will teach you how to describe the world, how to analyse it then have an own conclusion from scientific perspective. </p>
<p>someone will say the algorithm of AI looks so simple from mathematics. it is correct in some ways, i have to agree with you. for example, the CNN network constructs with add, times and some special exponential calculation. most machine learning algorithm only need a little statical knowledges if you want to apply those. however, the most difficult thing is not from one to two, is not expanded a theory, is not inputting any parameters and clicking ENTER button, the most important thing is from zero to one, is finding the correct method from almost infinite possibles.  </p>
<p>it is easy to understand basic architecture of a neural network for anyone who have high school mathematical knowledges. it is true everyone could build own basic machine learning and some simple deep learning programs after accepting several months related training. however, it is not anyone could interpret principle behind his model by mathematical language in my view. </p>
<p>for example, it could be seen an iteration process, which fuzzied or transformed original data then extracing by some activation function from feedforward way for a deep learning network such as CNN. one  mathematical explanation of it is that a process which is a degeneracy of a high dimension manifold from input data to output outcome.  someone also thought basic component of a neural network just a mathematical function, but why does a simple function could achieve a more complicate mission? moreover, the Stephen Wolfram define a concept， Cellular automaton， in his book “ a new kind of science”. he portrayed a magical phenomenon that could create a complex images through some very simple rules. </p>
<p>teaching someone using a tool is easy, teaching someone understanding a tool is not easy. </p>
