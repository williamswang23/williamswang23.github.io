<h2 id="section-1"><a href="#section-1" class="headerlink" title="section 1"></a>section 1</h2><p>i will abstract some interesting points of the above papers, especially the latter, in this section.<br>the style transferring learning load one style to another content by GAN paradigm, which is known by most of us. the first magic point is they design the architecture of the model with two modules, the content and the style. because the model’s outcomes need to meet two requirements, outputting special text with a given style or imitating the style, facebook design a NN model with two modules achieving those assignments.<br>moreover, the facebook also makes a novel loss function to train the model.<br>$L=L_D+\lambda_4L_R+L_{type}+\lambda_5L_{rec}+\lambda_6L_{cyc}$<br>the LD denotes the discriminator-based adversarial loss. the L_type refers to losses computed by the typeface classification network. the latter two segments are the reconstruction and cyclic reconstruction losses, respectively.<br>they assess style and contents difference by the typeface classifier, an OCR recognition model and a discriminator. the total error is measured by MSE with l2, SSIM and PSNR.<br>although it is inevitable some failures in its outcomes, the model improves the style-transferring learning to another field, the texture.we are too  self-congratulation if inveigled by the model’s outcomes. it is true the facebook making a surprise that they  expand the style-transferring technology, but inventing. </p>
<h2 id="section-2"><a href="#section-2" class="headerlink" title="section 2"></a>section 2</h2><p>first of all, anyone wanting to learn ML and NN should know those are just the data,such as pictures, voices and text. for example,the picture is a high dimension matrix, and the voice and text are the high dimension vectors. the training process of a NN model is just optimazing their parameters, the weighted of each layer, to imitate the outcomes assigned in advance in a supervised learning. anyone learned linear algebra and geometry can understand that we can mapping a matrix to a point in a high dimension space. the spatial difference of those point depend on their features. we may never know the real key points or features of an object, but we can use a super-power model, such as NN, to imitate it. we describe an object by approaching it with a function, even if we cannot predict how long time to take. the turing machine is an analogous machine. we can prove its existence, and have found more and more successful examples as the improvement of technology and computing power.   </p>
