<p>“ The best junction point of finance and machine learning is optimization”, someone said.<br>The optimization is an important topic in general machine learning. All related mathematical theories of machine learning and the target in a model training process are fundamental to find an optimal path to the minimum error state. The optimization is also a critical skill in finance, such as portfolio optimization, saving trading costs, and risk control. </p>
<p>I always want to find some way that mining market patterns then directing trading, but all traditional theories were based on the financial framework. Those are too superficial to capture the root logic of the market in my view. They are also so low frequency that lacking practical significance in some sense. </p>
<p>I learned some cases of machine learning and NN methods about applying those technologies to finance. However, all of that either having similar flaws with traditional financial theories or are too rude in transferring. I must distinct those traditional theories are reasonable in their special circumstances, but not which I want. I also learned the RL method that owns great achievements in the games field and can give much spirit to me. Unfortunately, the scholars researching related methods cannot progress any significant improvement over they have owned. The alpha series agents are amazing, frankly speaking, but the new products matured too slowly. </p>
<p>Then I turned to read some mathematics books about modern mathematical theories occasionally. The modern algebra describes the objectives from some definitions about field, group, and ring. Moreover, it introduces the vector space, mapping, and matrix. It is also a crucial point that the relationships between different matrices, which depend on the resource of elements and their architectures. The homomorphism is introduced when two spaces have some special patterns, a homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type (such as two groups, two rings, or two vector spaces). In my view, I consider this conception can be used in extracting driven factors of various assets or market behaviors then compressing the low information-noise ratio data to more explicit ones firstly. Moreover, we can discover some more effective perspectives to analyse the market, from an abstractive sense. However, i find it may be more suitable in optimization process than the above circumstance. Based on those related methods, we can improve the calculated efficiency than before, especially in high dimension problems. </p>
<p>Applying modern mathematical methods in optimization process may be a way that will built a practical model more easily. Applying machine learning methods to this process may be also an efficient way than predicted in the same sense. We should assess more details in a variety of frequency levels. </p>
