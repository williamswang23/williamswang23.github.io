Although that paper’s idea is creative, the logic is too simple to illustrate the explicit differences of the logic between the general deep learning method and financial market data analysis.</p>
<p>Several noticed issues should be taken more attention when analyzing financial market data. Firstly, the financial data is low information-noise ratio data. That means some models with higher fitting capacity would drop in the overfitting trap, especially for the deep learning model. Even those AI models have profound potential in solving those complex problems in different fields. Secondly, the data snooping issue should also be alert. The most magic point in the financial market is all data captured by the analysts are sample data.</p>
<p>Moreover, those sample data have inner-correlation property. At the same time, those data are not be sampled in a random way. Those characteristics reveal that any models should be tested cautiously in the back-test process. The features of the test set may mislead the outcome of the assessing process. Using a mixture model to simulate the financial data’s dynamic patterns is rational. However, it is an abuse of compelling a model to fit the input and output when neglecting the unique features of those data. For example, random sampling a feature or indicator be the input variable, then choosing the output in the similar way. Those rough ideas only reflect the author’s arrogance. </p>
<p>There is a consensus that the financial market is a pseudo-explicit system. The complex mechanism behind its surface should be treatment prudently. The financial market has never given any forgiven opportunities to anyone. The loss will be an extraordinary course for those self-satisfied men if the model embeds some flaws. </p>
