<p>the alpha-Go model has two networks, the policy network and value network. there are so many reviews paper discussed the alphago, you can search those papers easily. but, there is a distinctive assumption for alphaGo, processed under full information circumstance. the financial market also has a particular property which is partial information circumstance,  the war fog. in addition to this, the financial market data we can watch from public information channel also are projection of high dimension space to low dimension space.  <strong>although, the mind behind alphaGO could give us much inpiration</strong></p>
<p>there are two major differences between Go game and financial market data in this issue.</p>
<ol>
<li>in a Go game, the player’s target is win the game, so the terminal node is predictable, but in financial market, player’s target is own positive gain but does not depend on price determinate direction. this property would obscure MC-tree’s terminal states. the parameters and process of MC-tree need to re-assess to match financial trading characteristics. </li>
<li>for Go game and alpha-Go, the decision of play would send information to the board, and opponent would receive it immediately. the game status would change cause of each decision of players. but except market maker or undefined magnate participants, none could make influence to the market significantly. it is reasonable to look Go game deciding process as a line with black and white break point, black point represent one player, and white represent the other.</li>
</ol>
<p>return to initial issue, the typical data of financial market is  price, and news, financial statements data, and analysis report supply complementary information about underlying assets. all of those information constructs a high dimension space in a high dimension set, whose properties are not distinct. that is problem one[^1]. </p>
<p>although original status is a high dimension space, but we only could collect low dimension data, the information deficiency data. if we can recovery degeneracy process from high to low dimension space, we could assess market form.<br>there are some conjectures about this process. </p>
<ol>
<li>kernal function. it is undoubtful that kernal function just a approximate alternation of actual evolutionary process.</li>
<li>supervised learning like policy network of alphaGo. the low dimension function is information deficiency. finding some properties from original high dimension space, then indexing to low dimension space, getting the approximate one in low dimension space, if those two space is bijection[^2]. then, we can carry the outcome to similar low dimension space to mapping back to high dimension which we could not have complete information. NN has strong fitting capacity for complex data, we could find features of market dynamic process through this method. and we should also notice the patterns is not constant, but also dynamic in some special dimension which also collapse from higher dimension.</li>
<li>compression and manifold. the financial market is a typical space with a great variety of compression and noise because of interaction of different participants with varying shock power. the data and information we looked just a manifold of real space. </li>
</ol>
<p>this essay just a rough idea after market shock yesterday. the proof is fill with subjective assumptions. but in my view, it also has great prospects.</p>
