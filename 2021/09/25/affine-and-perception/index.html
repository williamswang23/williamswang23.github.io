Nonetheless, I promise I will write it comprehensible as possible as I can. </p>

<p>The first question to understand is affine space and affine transformation.<br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space">Affine space - Wikipedia</a><br><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation">Affine transformation - Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>The affine space is a general space that covering all linear functions. It preserves some features of points or vectors in a space that including collinearity, parallelism, convexity, ratios of lengths of parallel line segments, and barycenters of weighted collections of points. It is obvious that linear function or, more generally speaking, the affine space can explain most relationships in most fields, and it is also understandable easily describing relationships by those linear functions. Nevertheless, it is enough to us, a curious creation? In my view, the affine space is just an approximation of the actual world, The human prefers thinking in this way, the linear function, moreover, the affine space, which is internalized in our neural system, is just a deterministic outcome of an energy-saving strategy that is an optimal choice in evolution.  </p>
<p>The energy is precious for our ancients. They must hunt, collecting foods continued and repeating day after day. The food supplying was so undefined that energy-saving became more important than other options. Moreover, the most crucial deciding organism, the brain, is high energy-consuming relatively. Under this condition, our body more prefers linear intuition and avoiding any non-linear or complex thinking patterns. </p>
<p>On the other side, the linear function clusters are simple and enough for solving most problems in history. The non-linear functions cluster is more complex than the former. Actually, there are a variety of sub-filed in non-linear functions cluster. Most of them are so distinctive that is difficult to classify them into one category. The research of them is just in beginning, and we have a long road to go. For example, the explanations of deep learning are controversial. The main view is there is a local linear relationship in a high dimension space, which means the objectives of some assignment, such as image discrimination, can be looked at as a manifold.</p>
<p>The most interesting point is the thinking pattern in our mind or our consciousness is linear, in other words, we can realize we use some linear function to link the objectives around the world, however, the fundamental architecture is non-linear in our brain. That also inspired the invention of the artificial neural network.</p>
