<a id="more"></a>

<p>I have learned the rust language from last month, while I have always written code with python from several years ago. The explicit differences between python and rust give me so many inspirations about understanding the ways that how the patterns of thinking affect the coding process.</p>
<p>The most significant feature of the python is what you see what you run. The interpreted language’s learning started point is too low to obscure anyone wanting to learn it. However, this feature is a two side sword for coding learning. The most serious outcome of it is you just know how to complete some simple and special assignments that have been finished by other masters, and the internal fundamental principles of it do not been learned you. The coder will become a machine element that cannot achieve some challenging missions. Because the coder learning in the former way does not understand the fundamental principles of the languages, the CPU, the memory of a computer that is hardware of a program, the processing order of the program, and the optimal way of the program. The statical language, such as C, C++, and rust, require a coder wanting to learn understanding not only the rules of languages but also the principles when a computer process the programs.</p>
<p>The interpreted language is easier to learn than complied language. Nevertheless, someone can have a deep understanding of the computing process learning it that will help the coder adapting the industry environment more quickly which is the ultimate target for any coders. The coder should guarantee the program to run continuously as long as possible under normal conditions. That means the coder should consider all possible problems which will break the programs’ processing, and trade off the efficiency and completeness of the program. There are several disadvantages of interpreted languages. Firstly, for example, the interpreted language is easier to read for human but the running speed is too slower than the compiled language. Secondly, the variables can be mutable is also dangerous for interpreted language, such as python, because the coder cannot control the variables’ value that will result in some breaks or false outcomes. The influences of those outcomes should be considered by the coder, however, it may be difficult to assess correctly. For avoiding this, some languages, such as rust, define the variables are immutable. Admittedly , The variables will mutable if you added a ‘mut’ before the variables in rust. At last, The program will be affected by too many factors in a production environment, partial factors can be forecasted but some cannot. Therefore, some programs passing in testing step by small and simple data set also occur the unexpected breaks. The statical languages adding some special rules into the codes will may not perform better but not worse certainly. Actually, the statical languages is more efficient than some interpreted languages, such as python. In some condition, they do not under same magnitude. The gap between them is too enormous. </p>
<p>Although the compiled languages require a user to learn more knowledge and its learning curve is also too steepen to the most coder, we should remember NO FREE LUNCH in the world. The harvest has a positive relationship with time taking for an assignment. Seeking a comfortable condition in the studying process will lead to someone losing some important things that will decide how long distance you will go in a field.</p>
