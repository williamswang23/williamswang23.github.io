<a id="more"></a>

<p>i will express my views in three points. </p>
<h2 id="paradigm"><a href="#paradigm" class="headerlink" title="paradigm"></a>paradigm</h2><p>the supervised learning and un-supervised learning are paradigm of Ml. the former uses label-date to training model, and the latter uses non-lable data. both of them have same target that finding a concrete pattern to solve a objective issue. the difference of them is material, the label data or not. this assumption result in different way to complete ML model. the target of supervised learning is finding a mapping pattern by minimizing a cost function. but for unsuervised learning, people should find different target function to extract features of data then construct the model with the data.</p>
<h2 id="algorithm"><a href="#algorithm" class="headerlink" title="algorithm"></a>algorithm</h2><p>based on respective paradigm, the ML scholar developed diverse algorithms to solve real problems. for example, the lasso which  resources from traditional statistical models, the decision trees and the random forest which are used for discrimination issues. the KNN is used for un-supervised cluster learning. no matter which algorithms, they just a concretizaion of paradigm. the paradigm results from objective properties of original data, the algorithms is a bridge between paradigm and completed model to solve problems.</p>
<h2 id="philosophy-and-math"><a href="#philosophy-and-math" class="headerlink" title="philosophy and math"></a>philosophy and math</h2><p>the mathematics permeates every corner of ML, from data mining to optimize cost function. any model is just a embodiment of mathematics. for example, we classify data by space distance, imitate unknown curve by linear function, degenerate a high dimension date to lower dimension, etc. but above those method is only tools which are too distinct to explain the too the distinctive world. we should imagine origin of those virgin data from algebra, topology and geometry perspective. how to assess similar of different data, what is essence of this world, how the world works, what is relationship of the things in a system. the data which we watched are just a data what we watched or a projection of high dimension space.<br><strong>Is the mathematics a prometheus fire or just a fooling tricks?</strong> </p>
