<p>The trading prices are a slice of completed market information. Indeed, the trading prices being seen from trading software are just reflected part information, a two-dimensional image. The complete market information should be a three-dimensional picture like the following one. It includes an order book axis, time axis, and volume axis. The red line illustrates the historical market price data while it ignores the order book data, representing and revealing historical market information at that time. Therefore, some traditional analysis tools focusing on the slice of the red line are one-sided methods.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ziAUp0C.jpg" alt="pic1"></p>
<p>It is reasonable to consider the FMPs as complex and irrational agents from some perspectives. They continuously receive market information and rumors from the environment before generating their unique expectations for assets’ potential price based on the biological NN network. Their expectation is almost two-dimension images because it is easier than three-dimension ones. The fundamental principle is the instinct of our brains to save energy. The expectation will drive traders’ actions which are basic units of the order book for any investable asset.<br><img src="https://i.imgur.com/PC1b5vh.jpg" alt="pic2"></p>
<p>Artificial intelligence algorithms’ most critical feature and advantage are they can isolate human instincts, which may be beneficial for many situations but trading behaviors. For instance, the brain will give up part preciseness to save energy when analyzing market information. </p>
<p>At last, there is an interesting question:  to what extent the market data can be looked like a manifold?</p>
