<p>As a holder of the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation, I am impressed with ChatGPT’s breadth and intelligence in various fields, particularly in the finance industry. However, it does have some limitations when it comes to numerical problems.</p>
<p>The CFA curriculum encompasses many sub-fields within the finance industry, with one of its primary goals being to assist clients in constructing appropriate portfolios over a specified time horizon. The integration of ChatGPT into the asset management industry could lead to the replacement of many junior asset management analysts, as certain basic investing principles can effectively handle the needs of most individual clients. Additionally, the cost-effectiveness and versatility of AI technology will likely attract many asset management companies to adopt it in place of human employees in the future.</p>
<p>However, it would be overly simplistic to suggest that all fund managers will lose their jobs. If all AI bots are constructed based on similar algorithms, all market bot-participants could miss out on potential profit opportunities. In essence, the presence of all AI could result in no AI. Furthermore, even if AI were to surpass human intelligence, there are many areas in which computers cannot match human abilities, such as the ability to make informed predictions based on historical data and personal experience. Additionally, AI can only imitate human behavior in simple environments.</p>
<p>Finally, creativity stems from the free-thinking of individuals and is a driving force behind technological advancements. Currently, I do not believe AI has the capacity for comparable creativity.</p>
