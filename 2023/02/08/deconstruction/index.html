<p>Nowadays, news has been talking about how ChatGPT has infiltrated every aspect of our lives. Some people believe that ChatGPT technology will significantly change our work and lifestyle. I agree with this view, though I have some reservations.</p>
<p>It is clear that ChatGPT has the capability to replace jobs that involve repetitive tasks, such as data collection and information gathering. It can also replace writing-based positions in companies, such as report writing and PPT presentation jobs. Additionally, ChatGPT can function as junior financial analysts and consultants in certain industries where creativity is not required.</p>
<p>However, jobs that require analytical and creative skills are still difficult to be replaced by ChatGPT technology. This is because ChatGPT can only cluster existing knowledge and information, making the output appear logical and wise. However, it may still have errors in both content and logical flow, which is not a true form of intelligence. Furthermore, simulated intelligence can also lead to tail risks, especially in critical industries. For instance, it is challenging to gain clients’ trust in building an investment portfolio using an AI-powered agent. The agent, being a black-box, can be difficult to understand.</p>
<p>Finally, workers can benefit from ChatGPT by improving their work efficiency and avoiding job loss. However, the ultimate solution to any technological disruption is to focus on improving skills that cannot be replaced by machines.</p>
